Synopsis

This app is inspired by the Sillicon Valley series. It allows you to evaluate your karma to find out if you have more chance to go to heaven or hell.

Motivation

I did it for fun after a training with @bltnico (react expert) as a react native application case.

Installation

You need at least an Android or iOS emulator to make it run.
Open a terminal in the folder of the app and run

react-native run-android
